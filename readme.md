## Skills

* UI Canvas
* Buttons
* Toggles
* Text

## Level 

Each Learning Unit has instructions as a txt file in the folder with the scene (Unit01 etc). The instructions will tell you what needs to be done for each unit.

## Bosses

### Bowser

Create a simple game that uses UI elements. 

NOTE: Any method on a Component that you want to access from a UI event needs to be "public". See the MoveObject script for reference. (We'll discuss access modifiers next week)

### Hornet

Modify one of your existing first-person games to have a HUD (head's up display) that shows important information about your game.

### Demon of Hatred

Do the Hornet-level challenge, but modify it so that all the values (e.g. player health) are tracked via Scriptable Objects instead of direct scene references. 

Also: create a working mini-map of your game.
